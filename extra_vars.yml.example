# Network Infrastructure Configurations #
#########################################

# NOTE: the Metal3 demo environment is consisted of two VMs, 
# metal3-network-infra and metal3-core respectively. The metal3-network-infra
# VM contains all necessary networking infrastructure components that
# Metal3 stack dependeds on, which are expected to be available in a
# typical production environment. i.e. DNS server, DHCP server, etc. 
# The metal3-core VM, on the other hand, has only the essential CAPI and
# Metal3 components. i.e. CAPI, RKE2 bootstrap and control plane provider,
# Metal3 infrastructure provider, baremetal operator, and Ironic.
# The external-dns in metal3-core is configured to utilize the DNS server
# running in metal3-network-infra. Likewise, metal3-core is leveraging the
# DNS server in metal3-network-infra for all DNS resolutions.
#
# The Metal3 demo environment is expected to have two networks, which are
# provisioning and public network. The provisioning network is used
# for provisioning, which means it must be able to access the bare metal
# computers (BMC). For all intents and purposes, the provisioning network
# is the same as the iLO network (or has route to the iLO network).
# The public network, as the name implies, should have access (egress)
# to the internet. It is used to download bits from public repos
# or endpoints during cluster provisioning. And it can also be used
# to access the workload cluster API endpoints.
#
# For same environments, though not recommended for obviouse reasons,
# provisioning and public network can be the same so as long as the
# network have public access.

#
# DNS domain for the Metal3 stack. All the public endpoints created in DNS
# will have this domain. e.g. boot.ironic.suse.baremetal, media.suse.baremetal, etc
#
dns_domain: suse.baremetal

#
# NIC for the provisioning network
#
# NOTE: Please configure the NIC after the "&metal3_provisioning_nic"
# part because we need this reference in the VM network configuration below.
#
metal3_provisioning_nic: &metal3_provisioning_nic eth0

#
# Host to VM NIC mapping, determines how to map host NICs to 
# VM NICs. This is the "--network" parameters for virt-install
# when creating the VMs.
